# Google-Image-Scraper

Hello all,
This is an automated system that can automatically extract the requested number of images from the Google Images. 
It is built using Selenium Library which is a web testing library used for Robotic Frameworks.

Structure of the project:

1. scrape_image.py  -> Contains the driver code
2. requirements.txt -> Dependencies of the Project
3. chromedriver.exe -> ChromeDriver for the Google Chrome Version we have on our Laptop/PC

(Note: Download the ChromeDriver according to your Google Chrome Version)

Steps to get the chromedriver.exe file:
- Go to Google Chrome
- Click on three dots on the rightmost top corner
- Go to help and click on about Google Chrome. You will find the chrome version here
- Download the chrome driver according to your version from here  " https://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/index.html " 
(In case the driver for your version is not available, download the nearest one version driver 
- Put it inside the same folder of your code
